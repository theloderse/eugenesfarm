## Installing the Mod

1. Build your mod to generate `EugenesFarm.dll`.
2. Move both `EugenesFarm.dll` and `manifest.json` into your Stardew Valley `Mods` folder.
   - Example path:  
     `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Mods\EugenesFarm`
   - its auto doing this for me, but check to ensure its there if its not running properly.
3. Launch Stardew Valley using SMAPI.
